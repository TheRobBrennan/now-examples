<Head>
  <title>MDX-deck on Zeit Now 2.0</title>
</Head>

---
# Our goal
Deploy a heavily customized mdx-deck presentation

---
# What will we need?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>A sample MDX-deck presentation</li>
    <li>A few changes to our configuration file</li>
    <li>An ability to type three letters and deploy our presentation</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
For this demo, there are three things that we are going to need.
```

---
# This demo contains...
<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Custom layouts</li>
    <li>Images and code snippets</li>
    <li>A custom React component to look at a code snippet</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# Initial configuration
Let's take a look at the `now.json` we need to create...

---
<CodeSurfer
  code={require("raw-loader!./snippets/example-nowconfiguration.snippet")}
  title="Zeit Now 2.0 - now.json"
  showNumbers
  steps={[
    {}, // First step should be an overview of the snippet
    {lines: [2], notes: "Specify version 2"},
    {lines: [3], notes: "Give our project a name"},
    {range: [4,6], notes: "Use @now/static-build when serving static content"},
    {range: [7,11], notes: "Define custom routes for additional content"},
    {lines: [8], notes: "Add a route for our images folder in the build directory"},
    {lines: [9], notes: "Add a route for our code snippets folder in the build directory"},
    {lines: [10], notes: "Add a route for our default page"},
    {}
  ]}
/>

---
# One more thing
Add a `now-build` script to `package.json` which
<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Builds a static site containing our presentation</li>
    <li>Recursively copies images to our new build directory</li>
    <li>Recursively copies code snippets to our new build directory</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# Deploy to Zeit Now
Simply type `now` and deploy your presentation...

---
# Demo
export default Invert

# Thank you
